\section{Working with images}
Because MATLAB was designed to work with matrices of numbers it is particularly well-suited to operate on images.
Recently, the Mathworks have also made efforts to become more user-friendly. Let's demonstrate:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Save and image to your desktop, e.g. ``Blobs.tif'' from ImageJ
\item Open the MATLAB app \lstinline{Image Viewer} either from the tool-strip or by typing \lstinline{imtool}
\item From the \lstinline{Image Viewer} go to \lstinline{File > Open ...} and select an image
\item Adjust the contrast, inspect the pixels, measure a distance, etc, using the tool-strip shortcuts
\end{enumerate}
