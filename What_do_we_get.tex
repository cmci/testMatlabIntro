What do we get if we repeat the above analysis? Try it.

\subsection{Simulating directed motion with random tracking error}
We may also want to create a time-series that is a hybrid:  We have a particle that moves with constant speed in one direction, but the position determination is contaminated with random tracking errors.
The simulation, again, is simple:
