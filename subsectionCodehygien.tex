\subsection{Codehygiene}
It is important for your future self, not to mention collaborators, that you keep good practices when coding.

\begin{itemize}
\item The actual code should be easy to read, not necessarily as compact as possible
\item Use descriptive names
\item Document the code
\item Insert plenty of blank spaces: Let your code breathe!
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:foldedCode} is and example of how your code could look, when folded, if you take care to structure it nicely --- notice how easy it to figure out what goes on where, without having to read a single line of actual code. Also, the currently active code-block is highlighted in yellow.
