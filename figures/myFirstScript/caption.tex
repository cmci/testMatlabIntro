\label{fig:theEditor} The editor window. The script is structured for easy human interpretation with clear blocks of code and sufficient documentation.
Starting from the percent sign all text to the right of it is ``outcommented'' and appears green, i.e., MATLAB does not try to execute it. A double percent-sign followed by space indicates the beginning of a code-block that can be folded (command-.), un-folded (shift-command-.) and executed (command-return) independently.
The currently active code-block is yellow.
The line with the cursor in it is pale-green. 
Notice the little green square in the upper right corner, indicating that MATLAB is happy with the script and has not warnings or suggestions.
