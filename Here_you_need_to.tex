Here, you need to be able to recognize that the toolbox names are abbreviated, so that, e.g., \lstinline{Image Processing Toolbox} is referred to simply as \lstinline{images}.  Any path to a function, as found with the \lstinline{which} command, that inludes \lstinline{.../toolbox/matlab/...} does not require a specific toolbox as it is part of the core MATLAB distribution.
