In step two we convert the \lstinline{logical} variable \lstinline{blobs_perimeter} to an 8-bit unsigned integer on the fly, before adding it to the image. If you wonder why we do this conversion, just try to omit it and read the error-message from MATLAB.

Now, let's make some measurements on the b/w image and display them on the \lstinline{blobs_summed} image from above:
