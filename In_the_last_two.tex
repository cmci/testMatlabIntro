In the last two lines we used the command \lstinline{disp} that displays its argument in the command window.
It takes as argument variables of many different formats, incl.\ numerical and strings. 
Here, we gave it a string variable that was concatenated from two parts, using the \{ and \} operators.
The first part is an ordinary string of text in single quotes, the second part is also a string but created from a numeric variable using the command \lstinline{num2str}.

The other MATLAB commands \lstinline{cumsum}, \lstinline{diff}, \lstinline{mean}, and \lstinline{std} do what they say and calculate the cumulative sum, the difference, the mean, and the standard deviation, respectively. Look up their documentation for details and additional input arguments.

\subsection{Plotting a time-series}
Ok, now let us plot some of these results:
