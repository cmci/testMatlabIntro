Repeat above analysis for this new time-series.
How does the speed determination depend on the degree of smoothing, sub-sampling, or $dt$?
Here, the concept of speed does make sense, and averaging over time (smoothing) should give a better determination.

\subsection{Loading tracking data from a file}
Instead of analyzing simulated data we often want to work on actual experimental data.
Our example today is the data generated in ImageJ when tracking spots in cells.
That output was an XML file and we need a parser (reader) for it called \lstinline{importtrackmatetracks.m}.
This function will return a cell-array of tracks consisting of time, x, y, and z positions:
