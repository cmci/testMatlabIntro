\subsection{Smoothing, thresholding and all that}
Yes, of course we can perform all these operations and here is a small taste of how it is done.
We are going to

\begin{enumerate}
\item Load an image and invert it
\item Create a copy of it that has been smoothed with a Gaussian kernel
\item Determine the Otsu threshold for this copy
\item Create a binary image based on the smoothed copy
\item Display the mask on the original
\item Apply this mask (binary image) to the original and make measurements
\end{enumerate}
