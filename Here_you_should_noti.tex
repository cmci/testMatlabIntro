Here, you should notice that the value of \lstinline{c} does not change until we have evaluated it again --- computers are fast, but they cannot not read our minds (most of the time), so we have to tell them \emph{exactly} what we want them to do.

Ok, that might have been somewhat underwhelming.  
Let us move on to something slightly more interesting and that you can probably not so easily do on your phone.

\subsection{Plot something}
Here are the steps we will take:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a vector $x$ of numbers
\item Create a function $y$ of those numbers, e.g. the cosine or similar
\item Plot $y$ against $x$
\item Label the axes and give the plot a title
\item Save the figure as a pdf file
\end{enumerate}

First we define the peak-amplitude (half of the peak-to-peak amplitude)
