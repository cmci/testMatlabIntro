\section{Tools}
We shall be using the commercial software package MATLAB as well as some of its problem specific toolboxes, of which there are currently more than 30.

\subsection{MATLAB}
Don't panic! MATLAB is easy to learn and easy to use. But you do still have to learn it.
MATLAB is short for \emph{matrix laboratory}, hinting at why MATLAB is so popular in the imaging community---remember that an image is just a matrix of numbers.
MATLAB is commercial software for numerical, as opposed to symbolic, computing.

\subsection{Image Processing Toolbox}
Absolutely required if you want to use MATLAB for image analysis.

\subsection{Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox}
Somewhat necessary for data-analysis, though we can get quite far with the core functionalities alone.
