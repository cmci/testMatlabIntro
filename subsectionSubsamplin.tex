\subsection{Sub-sampling a time-series (slicing and accessing data)}
Sometimes we can get useful information about our time-series by sub-sampling it.
An example could be a signal $x$, that is corrupted by nearest-neighbor correlations: To remove this, simply remove every second data-point, like this:
