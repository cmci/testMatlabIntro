\label{fig:OT_MSD} Mean-squared displacement for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (persistent random motion), Brownian motion in an optical trap (confined diffusion), and Brownian-motion proper (free diffusion). Straight lines show slopes of one (green) and two (blue), for comparison to the cases of Brownian motion and linear motion.
Green points: Freely diffusing massless particle (Einstein's Brownian motion); red points: trapped massless particle (OT limit, or OU velocity process); and blue points: freely diffusing massive particles (time integral of OU process). This is Fig.~8 in \cite{Norrelykke:2011}.
