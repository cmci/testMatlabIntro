\section{Aim}
You will learn to use MATLAB to analyse data extracted from the preceeding tracking module (as you have no doubt noticed, the strength of ImageJ does not lie in data-analysis).
You will also be introduced to some of the powerful and flexible image-analysis methods native to MATLAB\@.
If this is the first time you code, except from writing Macros in ImageJ, then this will also serve as a crash course in programming for you.
