Alternatively, if all we wanted was the name of a directory we would use the command \lstinline{uigetdir} --- you can guess what it does.

Why did we just do all this? 
We did it because we often have to spend a lot of time on data-wrangling before we can even get to the actual data-analysis. Knowing how to easily extract file and path names for your data allows you automate many later steps. Example: You might want to open each image in a directory, crop it, scale it, smooth it, then save the results to another directory with each modified image given the same name as the original but with ``\_modified'' appended to the name.
