Here is what we just did: 1) We navigated to the directory holding our image; 2) Read the image into the variable \lstinline{myBlobs} using the \lstinline{imread} command; 3) Selected figure number 1 (or created it if it didn't exist yet) and cleared it; 4) Displayed the content of our variable \lstinline{myBlobs} in figure 1; 5) Selected, or created, figure number 2 and cleared it; 6) Again displayed the content of \lstinline{myBlobs} but now with the displayed gray-scale confined (especially relevant for 16bit images that otherwise appear black), and the displayed image fitted to the size of the window.

\subsection{Extracting meta-data from an image}
Because we are becoming serious image-analysts we also take a look at the meta-data that came with the image.
