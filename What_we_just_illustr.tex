What we just illustrated, was how to read only selected entries from a vector; in the first example we read every second entry from the beginning (the first element in a vector in MATLAB has index 1, not 0), in steps of 2, until the end.
The same idea holds for arrays of arbitrary dimension in MATLAB; each dimension is treated independently.

If we wanted, we could also have given a list of indices to read, like this:
